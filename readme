Goals
=====

	1. to perform better than AWS SDK v2.x
	2. be under 150kb at runtime (in total, including avaje libraries)
	3. to implement full support for AWS Signature v4
	4. to be smooth to migrate to, coming from AWS SDK v2.x

	5. to function correctly on, ideally be tested on:

		- Amazon S3
		- MinIO
		- Garage
		- Ceph
		- CloudFlare R2
		- Backblaze B2
		- DigitalOcean Spaces
		- Oracle Object Storage

	6. to support essential subset of S3 features:

		- CreateBucket
		- HeadBucket
		- ListBuckets

		- ListObjectsV2
		- GetObject
		- PutObject
		- DeleteObject
		- DeleteObjects
		- HeadObject
		- CopyObject

		- ListMultipartUploads
		- CreateMultipartUpload
		- CompleteMultipartUpload
		- AbortMultipartUpload
		- UploadPart

Security
========

	1. The library suppresses sensitive information when logging.
	2. No warranty is provided for any data loss / security breaches resulting from improper usage.
	3. XXE hardening is a lower priority, over compatibility & portability. The S3 host is considered a trusted host.
	4. Technical "bail out" can be performed simply by using the underlying `HttpClient`.
	5. If you find a security vulnerability, please report it to "esthree@mechite.com".
